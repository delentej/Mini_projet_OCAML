# Mini_projet_OCAML
Hello !
To launch the project :
  Compile:  ocamlbuild ftest.byte
  Execute:  ./ftest.byte graph1 0 5 graphtest.txt
  Generate a png: dot -Tpng graphtest.txt > graphtestoo.png


We generate every good step to find the final graph, but we have some problem with the display of the graph.
